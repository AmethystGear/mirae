# mud
A terminal game where you explore a randomly generated world and fight monsters!

mud is 100% text based, but it uses 256-color (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit) to display 'images' by printing out sequences of characters.
If your terminal doesn't support 256-color, then either get a new terminal, or alternatively download vscode, which comes with a dedicated terminal that runs xterm, which supports 256-color.
vscode runs on pretty much all platforms, so it's a good choice.
